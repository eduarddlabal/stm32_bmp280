## Introduction

The BMP280 is a barometric pressure sensor that can be used to measure atmospheric pressure and temperature. This project integrates the BMP280 sensor with an STM32 microcontroller to read and display sensor data. BMP 280 is interfaced using I2C bus.

## Hardware Requirements

- STM32F103C8T6 "BluePill" microcontroller
- BMP280 sensor module
- LCD display with I2C

## Software Requirements

- STM32CubeMX
- CMake
- GCC ARM toolchain

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BMP280TEST.git
    cd BMP280TEST
    ```

2. Open the project in STM32CubeMX and generate the code.

3. Build the project using CMake:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```


## References
This project uses code from the following repositories:

- [STM32_HAL_I2C_HD44780](https://github.com/eziya/STM32_HAL_I2C_HD44780) for interfacing with the HD44780 LCD display over I2C.
- [BMP280_STM32](https://github.com/ciastkolog/BMP280_STM32/tree/master) for interfacing with the BMP280 sensor.

## Notes
- please note that this README was generated by Copilot AI
- projects contains code for inteterfacing two LEDs and button, but they are not used
- if you want to use a controller other than BluePill, you must configure STM32CubeMX for it
